<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>18. Guidelines for Law Enforcement Agency</strong></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">If you are a law enforcement agency, we may work with you to assist in on-going matters related to alleged violations of the law.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>19. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</strong></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Posterfans and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">No Representative Actions. You and Posterfans agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Posterfans , and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. <u>The limitations imposed by this section apply to, but are in no way limited to, class action refund claims brought by a class of taxpayers against&nbsp;</u>Posterfans <u>related to taxes collected and remitted in good faith efforts at compliance with state and local marketplace facilitator or marketplace provider laws. Nothing in this section will be construed to prohibit a buyer from filing a refund claim with the seller or applicable state and local tax authority as permitted by law.</u></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Posterfans seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Posterfans seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Posterfans waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Posterfans or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first contact Posterfans, and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) to Posterfans by email at team@posterfans,com or by certified mail addressed to Posterfans, 455 NE 5th Ave, Ste D117, Delray Beach, FL 33483</p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">The Notice must (a) include your name, your residence address, your email address, your telephone number, and, if you have registered for an Posterfans account, the email address your account is registered under if it is different from your current email address; (b) your Posterfans account username; (c) a description of the nature and basis of the claim; (d) details on the specific Posterfans item or transaction in question; and (e) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and Posterfans cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Miami-Dade County.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, arbitrations may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than $10,000. You and Posterfans agree that arbitrations will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (&quot;<strong><em>JAMS Rules</em></strong>&quot;). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><u><strong>JAMS website</strong></u></a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">You and Posterfans agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 21 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1, <em>et seq</em>. (the &quot;<strong><em>FAA</em></strong>&quot;), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&apos;s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator, Posterfans , and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">You and Posterfans agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Posterfans will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Posterfans , Posterfans will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Posterfans agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Florida and the United States sitting in Miami-Dade County, Florida have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and&nbsp;</strong>Posterfans <strong>will not have the right to assert the claim.</strong></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>20. Governing Law and Venue</strong></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;">Any dispute arising from these Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Florida, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Florida or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Florida and the United States, respectively, sitting in Miami-Dade County, Florida. <span style="color: #0f0f0f;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>

<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;"><strong>22. Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></p>
<p style="color: #0f0f0f;background-color: #ffffff;">The failure of Posterfans to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
